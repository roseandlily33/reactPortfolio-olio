# My Portfolio
My portfolio built with react

## Description:
This is my react portfolio, I included some animations, you can contact me by filling out a form in the contact page, you can download my resume by pressing the yellow button on the resume page, and when you hover over the images for my projects they turn a dark grey and turn to the right, when you click on them it will take you to the deployed application - NOTE: Some of the applications are not deployed anymore because they are either not mine or are deployed to heroku and I have taken them all down because my credit card has been charged.

## Process of development:
The first thing that I did was create a vision board of the colours, fonts, and the layouts of what I wanted including the components that would need to be made. After I got everything running and working with react, I started with the navbar and the footer, then continued to making all the different pages.
