My Personal Portfolio

## Description:
Welcome to my portfolio
- NOTE: My portfolio is currently under development as I am tidying up certain projects and am deploying them. Most of them at this time are deployed and completed. 
- NOTE: Some of the group applications have been taken down and are not under my control, feel free to check out the attatched repo to those projects

## Deployed Link:
[My Portfolio](https://reactportfolio-olio.onrender.com)

## Created With:
React, npm package: react-router-dom, Javascript, CSS, emailjs.

## Process of development:
The first thing that I did was create a vision board of the colours, fonts, and the layouts of what I wanted including the components that would need to be made. After I got everything running and working with react, I started with the navbar and the footer, then continued to making all the different pages.
