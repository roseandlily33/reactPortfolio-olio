        <strong>Phase 1 (Sept 7, 2025):</strong>
        Ariel started with her own design. I created mockups, color palettes,
        font options, and a logo to unify the brand. After a discovery call, we
        clarified the target audience, streamlined navigation, and identified
        unnecessary pages. I provided a detailed list of recommendations for
        improvement.

        <strong>Phase 2 (Sept 13, 2025):</strong>
        Ariel implemented the new color palette, fonts, and many
        recommendations. I reviewed the updated site, suggested further
        refinements, and helped combine and reorganize content for clarity. The
        brand is now visually cohesive and much more engaging.

        <strong>Phase 3: (October, 2025)</strong>
        We worked on improving the overall structure of the site, spacing etc
        for the main page and the contact page. We went over highlighting
        certain details, discussing where certain things should be moved to make
        the user experience more fluid and intuitive.
