        <p>💗 Tastes like: A midsummer picnic in a flower field.</p>
        <p>
          Step into a garden of soft petals and sun-kissed berries. This dreamy
          blend balances the delicate aroma of rose petals with juicy
          strawberries and a kiss of golden honey. Blush Garden is floral,
          fruity, and subtly sweet—a gentle love letter to your senses.

        <p>🌼 Tastes like: Golden hour in a bottle.</p>
        <p>
          Soothing chamomile and creamy vanilla wrap around a burst of fresh

        <p>💜 Tastes like: A secret garden in full bloom.</p>
        <p>
          Dark berries meet soft florals and a whisper of nutty sweetness.
          Violet lends its floral perfume to tart raspberry, rounded off by
          smooth almond notes for a lush, almost dessert-like treat.

          keeps it crisp and refreshing. Fresh Root is bright, energizing, and
          bold—a modern tonic with old-soul roots.

        <p>
          A delicate bouquet of lavender floats above soft peach nectar and a
          drizzle of sweet honey. Peach Petal is lush, elegant, and subtly
          floral—a peaceful pause in your busy day.

          Earthy carrot, citrusy lime, and the sunny essence of marigold come
